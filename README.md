## Paper Implementation ##
### [Implementing AlexNet in PyTorch](https://github.com/khalidsbn/Implementing-AlexNet-in-PyTorch)
- Re-creates the 2012 ImageNet-winning AlexNet architecture (5 conv + 3 FC layers) entirely in PyTorch, staying faithful to kernel sizes, strides and LRN/dropout details. 
- Single, well-commented `alexnet.py` and an explanatory README break the model down layer-by-layer with spatial-dimension math — great for pedagogy or quick experiments.
- Lightweight repo (one script + docs) that compiles and trains out-of-the-box, making it an easy reference for CNN fundamentals in your portfolio.

### [ImageNet Insights](https://github.com/khalidsbn/ImageNet-Insights)
- Deep-dive summary of the 2009 ImageNet paper, plus the original PDF for reference. Covers scale (3.2 M images / 5,247 synsets) and WordNet-based hierarchy. 
- Walks through the two-stage data-collection pipeline (web scraping → Mechanical Turk vetting) that achieved ~99.7 % label precision. 
- Compares ImageNet to Caltech-256, TinyImages, etc., highlighting why its density and hierarchy changed computer-vision benchmarks. 
- Outlines key applications—object recognition, tree-based classification, localization—and how ImageNet sparked architectures from AlexNet to ResNet. 
- Includes a ready-to-run PyTorch snippet for loading ImageNet and notes on using pre-trained models for transfer learning.
